        <h4>Last Modified: 29 Jan, 2020</h4>
        <p class="text-muted">The Movie Box is a fast and fun way to get information about tv show and movie and share experiences with your friends and the world around you. You can view cinema details, get their show times and ticket prices. You can also read up on movies synopsis and watch trailers instantly with a click of a button. We don't stop at that; we give you the tool to show off about a new movie trailer you have just watched or a movie you have watched or planning to watch using the sharing tool. Share movies on social media so that with a click, your friends can view the movie and even watch the trailer on their mobile devices.<br> When you sign up for an account and interact with our application, you'll inevitably share some information with us.

        <p class="text-muted">We want you to be in control of your information, so we provide you with the following tools. </p>
        <ul class="text-muted">
            <li>Access and Updates. We strive to let you access and update most of the personal information that we have about you. There are limits though to the requests we'll accommodate. We may reject a request for a number of reasons, including, for example, that the request risks the privacy of other users, requires technical efforts that are disproportionate to the request, is repetitive, or is unlawful. You can access and update most of your basic account information right in the app by visiting the app's Settings page. Because your privacy is important to us, we may ask you to verify your identity or provide additional information before we let you access or update your personal information. We will try
            to update and access your information for free, but if it would require a disproportionate effort on our part, we may charge a fee. We will of course disclose the fee before we comply with your request. <br>
            If you would like to manage, change, limit, or delete your information, we allow you to do that through the following tools:</li>
            <li>Services Settings. You can change your settings to manage certain information available to other users. You can manage your contacts, groups, and broadcast lists, or use our block feature to manage the users with whom you communicate.</li>

When you delete your The Movie Box account, your undelivered messages are deleted from our servers as well as any of your other information we no longer need to operate and provide our Services. Be mindful that if you only delete our Services from your device without using our in-app delete my account feature, your information may be stored with us for a longer period. Please remember that when you delete your account, it does not affect the information other users have relating to you, such as their copy of the messages you might have sent them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>ANALYTICS AND ADVERTISING SERVICES RENDERED</h4>
        <p class="text-muted">We may let other companies use cookies, web beacons, and similar tracking technologies on the services. These companies may collect information about how you use the services and other websites and online services over time and across different services. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand your online activity. Additionally, some companies may use the information they collect on our services to deliver targeted advertisements on behalf of us or other companies, including on third-party websites and apps. The Movie Box does not currently respond to do-not-track signals that may be sent from your device. If we do so in the future, we will provide information about that practice in an updated version of this privacy policy. </p>

        <h4>CONCLUSION AND REVISIONS TO THE PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
        <p class="text-muted">We may change this privacy policy from time to time. But when we do, we'll let you know one way or another. Sometimes, we'll let you know by revising the date at the top of the privacy policy that's available on our website and mobile application. Other times, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites' homepages or providing you with an in-app notification). All of our rights and obligations under our Privacy Policy are freely assignable by us to any of our affiliates, in connection with a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise, and we may transfer your information to any of our affiliates, successor entities, or new owner. </p>
